# Expanding-cards
Cards are displayed using a flexbox container. Each card has an image and a title, and when clicked, the card expands to show a description. The CSS uses the :hover pseudo-class to apply a hover effect, and the JavaScript uses the classList.toggle() method to add or remove the show class, which controls the visibility of the description.
